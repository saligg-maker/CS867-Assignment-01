# CS867-Assignment-01
This my github Respositery related to Computer Vision course Assignment 01 that I am taking right now at NUST SEECS.

## 2.1:
I have used some of the provided images and displayed them using opencv library in python.

## 2.2:
I have created a function in helper script which was used for removing Red, Green or Blue values from image according to user need.

## 2.3:
I have understood the concept of histogram equalization by perfoming this method on different images and observing it's effects.

## 2.4:
I have built a function for convolution purposes this function takes an image and kernal in matrix form and then it convolves and return's the resultant Image I have applied different filters and observe their effects.

## 2.5:
I have applied different types of noises to image like (Salt & pepper , Gaussian) and after that I applied smoothing filters and observe their effects also I have experimented with different values of sigma.

## 2.6:
I have used different edge detection techniques like sobel, laplacian of gaussian and canny edge detector and observer their effects

## Conclusion:
This assignment gave me a lot of knowledge espically when it comes to using opencv in python it was a nice way to prepare me and due to this I developed a lot of interest in Computer vision that will be beneficial for me in future
